				<h2>About Me</h2>

				<img id="about_me_image" src="assets/images/about_me.png" alt="Me">
				<p>For the past 5 years I have worked as a Promotional Web Developer. I was basically a Front-End Web Developer for the Promotional Department within that company.</p>
				<br/>
                <p>Last year I was promoted to Software Developer I. Even though, I didn't think I deserved the promotion, I suffered from a serious case of "Imposter Syndrome" as a result. I learned technology based procedures, related softwares and the art of blending in within a technology department of 50 employees.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>I always felt the need to learn the basics of Web Development. I am self-taught and very eager to learn as much as I can in this Fullstack Web Development Bootcamp course here at UCLA.</p>
